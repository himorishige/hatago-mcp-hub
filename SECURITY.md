# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Supported Versions

- Active development: the latest major release line (N)
- Maintenance: previous major (N-1) receives critical fixes for up to 6 months after N is released

Older versions are considered end‑of‑life and will not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately:

- Preferred: Send a private DM on X (Twitter) to [@\_himorishige](https://x.com/_himorishige)
- Alternative: If available, open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories on this repository

Do not create a public issue for security reports.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and, where possible, provide a fix or mitigation within 90 days.

## Disclosure Process

Once a fix is available, we will coordinate a disclosure that includes:

- Affected packages and versions
- Impact and severity
- Mitigations or workarounds when available
- Credits to the reporter (if desired)

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem safe.
