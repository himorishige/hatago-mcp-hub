# Changelog

All notable changes to Hatago MCP Hub will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.6] - 2025-09-06

### Fixed

- Send `notifications/tools/list_changed` once after startup to ensure clients fetch and display the tool list. (Hotfix)

### Chore

- Bump all package versions to `0.0.6` and align hardcoded versions in source (serverInfo/hub_version).

## [0.0.5] - 2025-09-03

### Fixed

- Configuration inheritance (`extends`) now properly preserves parent properties (#26, #29)
- Hub prioritizes preloaded config to ensure extends processing is applied
- STDIO mode now requires config file and provides clear error message (#28)
- Prevented potential message loss in STDIO mode by setting up listeners before hub initialization (#27)

### Added

- Unit tests for config loading priorities
- Debug/warn logging for config source selection

### Improved

- Code comments and error handling in Hub.start() method
- Enhanced logging for better debugging of configuration loading

## [0.0.4] - 2025-09-03

### Added

- Configuration inheritance via `extends` (single or multiple parents, deep merge with child override)
- Support for preloaded configuration data during hub initialization
- Timeout configuration schema with global defaults and per-server overrides

### Changed

- Moved Node-specific utilities from `@himorishige/hatago-core` to `@himorishige/hatago-server`
- Updated development guidelines to emphasize ESLint usage and environment-specific utility policies

### Fixed

- Correct type casting in `mergeConfigs` to properly handle `unknown`
- Correct MCP server configuration examples (URL path and `npx` args)

### Security

- Enhanced path validation and protection against prototype pollution

### Docs

- Added team development use cases
- Clarified configuration loading priority and type definition for `preloadedConfig`
- Updated credits to include Hono framework
- Refreshed configuration examples and server endpoint usage

### Tests

- Added E2E tests covering handshake, streaming, and tool flows
- Additional unit tests and fixtures

### Chore

- Added `.serena` cache directory to `.gitignore`

### Notes

- Backward compatible. Existing configurations continue to work without changes.

## [0.0.3] - 2025-09-01

### Added

- Timeout controls across transports and hub flows:
  - Connection timeout for server connections (fail fast on connect)
  - Per-request timeout for tool invocations (server-specific or default)
  - Configurable HTTP/SSE keep-alive interval applied by Hub

### Docs

- Configuration Guide: document tag-based filtering (added in 0.0.2) and keep it consistent with CLI options

### Notes

- These changes are backward compatible. If no timeout values are specified, prior defaults apply.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-09-01

### Added

- üè∑Ô∏è **Tag-based server filtering**: Filter MCP servers using tags with OR logic
- **Multi-language tag support**: Full support for Japanese tags (e.g., "ÈñãÁô∫", "Êú¨Áï™")
- **CLI --tags option**: New command-line option to specify tags for filtering
  ```bash
  hatago serve --tags dev,test
  hatago serve --tags ÈñãÁô∫,„ÉÜ„Çπ„Éà
  ```
- **Configuration tags field**: Optional tags array in server configuration
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "server-id": {
        "command": "...",
        "tags": ["dev", "ÈñãÁô∫"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Changed

- Updated JSON Schema to include tags field definition
- Enhanced Zod schema validation for tags
- Improved hub filtering logic with tag support

### Technical Details

- Tags use OR logic: servers match if they have ANY of the specified tags
- Tags field is optional to maintain backward compatibility
- Tag filtering applies at startup time (not per-request in HTTP mode)
- Full test coverage for tag filtering functionality

## [0.0.1] - 2025-08-31

- Simplified architecture (38+ files removed from original design)
- Core functionality in ~500 lines hub implementation
- Multi-transport support (STDIO, HTTP, SSE)
- Hot reload capability with config watching
- Progress notification forwarding
- Internal management tools
- Environment variable expansion
- Claude Code compatible configuration format

### Features

- **Hub Core**: Central coordinator for multiple MCP servers
- **Server Types**: Support for local, NPX, and remote servers
- **Session Management**: Client isolation with independent sessions
- **Tool/Resource/Prompt Registry**: Complete MCP entity management
- **Configuration**: JSON Schema validation with TypeScript types
